# ğŸ›¡ SafeRoute AI â€“ City-Sakhi  

An *AI-powered Safety Heatmap and Route Planner* that helps users find the *safest routes* in urban areas by crowdsourcing real-time safety reports (harassment, poorly lit areas, crowded zones, etc.) and integrating with *Google Maps + Firebase*.  

The application calculates a *Safety Score (0â€“100)* for routes, highlights risky areas with colored markers, and allows users to report incidents for community safety.
